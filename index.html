	<p>
		Our goal is not to extract free work out of you with this project;
		please spend no more than 10 hours on this project. We believe that
		any developer claiming to be a "journeyman" developer can complete
		this in that time, but we also understand that certain developers
		do some things faster than others.
	</p>
	<p>
		You are free to use whatever libraries, packages, open-source tools,
		or other developer productivity aids you find helpful. If you use
		any, please let us know, because we're always looking for ways for
		us to improve our own productivity, too.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the problem that you choose includes data, please feel free to use a database or any other datastore that you prefer.  If sample data is provided, please use that in your solution.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are two components to each project: the domain, and the
		interface. Please make sure you address both components; while it is
		not an immediate disqualification to address only one and not the
		other, it does give us pause.

		<h2>Car Dealership</h2>
		<p>A car dealership has a large inventory of cars and needs a tool to help their customers narrow down which cars they could be interested in. Each automobile has several properties that will be used for the search. The manager at the dealership wants to give their customers the option to select 1 or more options as search criteria and give them the option to say that they want any of those options or all of those options.</p>
		<p>In other words, a customer should be able to say, "I want my car to have a sun roof, 4 wheel drive, and power windows". The customer should also be able to say "I want a car with navigation, sun roof, or low miles."</p>
		<p>Create a tool with these filtering options that returns a list of automobiles fulfilling the customer’s request. The customer input form should include a way for customers to enter their criteria and whether they want all or some criteria to be matched.</p>
		<p>The returned result-set should include the make, year, and which properties are fulfilled.</p>
		<p>Car Options:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Color (Red, White, Gray, Silver, Black)</li>
			<li>Automatic transmission</li>
			<li>sun roof</li>
			<li>4 wheel drive</li>

		<h2>E-Commerce Shipping</h2>
		<p>An e-commerce store wants to add a feature which describes the date a product would ship if purchased.</p>
		<p>Each product in their inventory has an integer N of max days to ship.  Also provided is an indication of whether the item ships on week days or not.  Given this data, generate the ship date for a product given a date ordered.  If an item has shipOnWeekends as true then weekends should count. If shipOnWeekends is false then the logic should ignore weekends and extend the ship date.</p>
		<p>
			When calculating the date, the first day to count should be the current date.  The date to display should be the last day in the count.
			E.g.,
			If a product is ordered Monday Oct 2nd and has a max ship days of 2, then the resulting date should be Tues, Oct 3rd. (First day in the count is Monday, second day in the count is Tues).
		</p>
		<p>
			E.g. 2,
			If a product is ordered in Jan 1st 2017 with a max ship days of 12 and only ships on weekdays, the return date should be 12 weekdays after Jan 1st, 2017.

		<h2>Maps Navigation</h2>
		<p>You're airdropped near Headquarters in a city somewhere. "Near", unfortunately, is as close as you can get - the instructions on you map start here. The Document indicates that you should start at the given coordinates (where you just landed) and face North. Then, follow the provided sequence: either turn left (L) or right (R) 90 degrees, then walk forward the given number of blocks, ending at a new intersection. There's no time to follow such ridiculous instructions on foot, though, so you take a moment and work out the destination. Given that you can only walk on the street grid of the city, how far is the shortest path to the destination? For example: Following R2, L3 leaves you 2 blocks East and 3 blocks North, or 5 blocks away. R2, R2, R2 leaves you 2 blocks due South of your starting position, which is 2 blocks away. R5, L5, R5, R3 leaves you 12 blocks away. How many blocks away is HQ?</p>
		<p>
			Sample input:
			"L3, R2, L5, R1, L1, L2"

			10 blocks away

	<div ng-show="interface === 'WebAPI'">
		<h2>Web API</h2>
		<p>
			We would like this to be a Web API endpoint, something that a Web
			or mobile client could use over HTTP to obtain data from the server.
			It should accept JSON (or XML, but we prefer JSON) as input, and
			likewise return JSON as output. The actual fomat of the JSON (or
			XML) is entirely up to you, but we would like you to use current
			conventions and RESTful principles as your guide in the design.
		</p>

		<p>
			The WebAPI should verify that the data in the incoming request
			is acceptable input, but you may assume (for practical purposes)
			that the incoming JSON (or XML) is always well-formed.
		</p>

		<p>
			Any errors should be communicated using traditional Web API
			(RESTful) error-reporting mechanisms.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div ng-show="interface === 'NativeUI'">
		<h2>Native GUI</h2>
		<p>
			We would like this to be a "native GUI" application; that is,
			we want to interact using the native user interface components of
			the platform. (This means specifically that we want to avoid the
			use of Web-like tools that create a user interface hidden within
			a Web browser on the system; we want you to write this using the
			native SDK of the target platform.)
		</p>

		<p>
			The UI does not need to be incredibly complicated--but if a simple
			text area asking for a string of input is used, it is up to you to
			verify that the input is correct and provide an example go along
			with it.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div ng-show="interface === 'WebClientUI'">
		<h2>Web (client) UI</h2>
		<p>
			We would like you to build this as a "single-page application"
			(or some other kind of entirely-browser-based solution). The user
			interface should be written in tools that ultimately produce an
			interface that can be loaded into a Web browser.
		</p>

		<p>
			Typically this will involve using JavaScript and libraries
			such as Angular, Durandal, or Ember, but if you have alternates
			that you would like to suggest and use, please let us know before
			doing so--clients are sometimes very particular about the tools
			used in their applications.
		</p>

		<p>
			It will be safe to assume that any "storage" required by the
			application can/should/will be done using Web APIs; you may
			mock the storage for those as you need, but the application must
			behave exactly the same if/when a back end is wired up to it.
			If you prefer to use a real back-end, you may, but we urge you
			not to spend a great deal of time on that--we are interested
			(and will be evaluating you) solely on your front-end skills.
		</p>

		<p>
			User interface is not a high
			priority for us, so it need not look incredibly pretty (though
			the use of a library like Bootstrap to help make it look at
			least a little pretty is a bonus!), but it must be entirely
			functional, and should be doing some basic validation of inputs.
			In addition, the output should be on a separate page from the
			inputs, in keeping with traditional Web style.
