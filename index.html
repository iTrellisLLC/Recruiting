<h1>Welcome!</h2>

Thank you for interviewing at iTrellis! We hope you find this process
to be fair, transparent, and understandable. Our goal with this
process is to evaluate your skill-set, with no "surprises" or "trick
questions" designed to snare the unwary. If you have any questions
about this project or its purpose in the process, please feel free
to email us at hr@itrellis.com.

Our goal is not to extract free work out of you with this project;
please spend no more than 10 hours on this project. We believe that
any developer claiming to be a "journeyman" developer can complete
this in that time, but we also understand that certain developers
do some things faster than others.

You are free to use whatever libraries, packages, open-source tools,
or other developer productivity aids you find helpful. If you use
any, please let us know, because we're always looking for ways for
us to improve our own productivity, too.

There are two components to each project: the domain, and the
interface. Please make sure you address both components; while it is
not an immediate disqualification to address only one and not the
other, it does give us pause.


<!-- 
  Domains
  -->
<div ng-show="domain === 'ToDoList'">    
<h2>TODO List</h2>
<p>The project goals are simple: We would like for you to
create an application that provides the ubiquitous "TODO list"
example application that is all the rage right now. The basic
functionality is given below:

<li>As a user, I can add a TODO to the list.</li>
<li>As a user, I can see all the TODOs on the list in an overview.</li>
<li>As a user, I can drill into a TODO to see more information about the TODO.</li>
<li>As a user, I can delete a TODO.</li>
<li>As a user, I can mark a TODO as completed.</li>
<li>As a user, when I see all the TODOs in the overview, if today's date is past the TODO's deadline, highlight it.</li>

A TODO consists of a task (just a simple sentence or two is fine),
a deadline date, a completed flag, and an optional "more details"
field that allows for more details to be given (again, a single
large text area is fine for this).</p>

<p>The list of TODOs can be kept in memory.</p>
</div>


<div ng-show="domain === 'PokerHands'">    
<h2>Poker Hands</h2>
<p>The project goals are simple: We would like a program that 
determines the winner of a round of poker.</p>

<p>For simplicity's sake, we will assume that there are two players, and
that each player is simply a name (String) that can be assumed to be
guaranteed elsewhere to be unique. (You need not verfiy the names are
unique, and if you want to use the names as unique identifiers that is
fine.)</p>

<p>A poker deck contains 52 cards. Each card has a suit of either
clubs, diamonds, hearts, or spades. Each card also has a value of either
2 through 10, jack, queen, king, or ace. For scoring purposes card values
are ordered as above, with 2 having the lowest and ace the highest value.
The suit has no impact on value.</p>

<p>A poker hand belonging to a player (which need only be tracked as a name;
names can be assumed to be unique) consists of five cards dealt from the 
deck. Poker hands are ranked by the following partial order from lowest to highest:

<ol>
<li>High Card: Hands which do not fit any higher category are ranked by the value of their highest card. If the highest cards have the same value, the hands are ranked by the next highest, and so on.</li>
<li>Pair: Two of the five cards in the hand have the same value. Hands which both contain a pair are ranked by the value of the cards forming the pair. If these values are the same, the hands are ranked by the values of the cards not forming the pair, in decreasing order.</li>
<li>Two Pairs: The hand contains two different pairs. Hands which both contain two pairs are ranked by the value of their highest pair. Hands with the same highest pair are ranked by the value of their other pair. If these values are the same the hands are ranked by the value of the remaining card.</li>
<li>Three of a Kind. Three of the cards in the hand have the same value. Hands which both contain three of a kind are ranked by the value of the three cards.</li>
<li>Straight. Hand contains five cards with consecutive values. Hands which both contain a straight are ranked by their highest card.</li>
<li>Flush. Hand contains five cards of the same suit. Hands which are both flushes are ranked using the rules for High Card.</li>
<li>Full House. Three cards of the same value, with the remaining two cards forming a pair. Ranked by the value of the three cards.</li>
<li>Four of a Kind. Four cards with the same value. Ranked by the value of the four cards.</li>
<li>Straight Flush. Five cards of the same suit with consecutive values. Ranked by the highest card in the hand.</li>
</ol>

The program needs to evaluate a pair of poker hands and to indicate which, 
if either, has a higher rank. You should include the winner's name as part
of the resulting output.</p>

<p>For example, if the hand belonging to "Ted" contains "2H", "3D", "5S", "9C", "KD",
and the hand belonging to "Louis" contains "2C", "3H", "4S", "8C", "AH", then
Ted has a HighCard, and Louis also has a HighCard, and Louis wins because his HighCard
is of higher rank than Ted's.</p>

<p>As another example, if the hand belonging to "Black" contains
"2H", "3H", "4H", "5H", "6H", and "White" contains the cards
"2C", "2H", "3H", "3C", "KH", then Black has a Straight Flush,
6-high, and White has a TwoPair, 3-high, and Black has the
winning hand.</p>
</div>


<div ng-show="domain === 'TripCalc'">
<h2>Trip Calculator</h2>
<p>The project goals are simple: We require a program that calculates 
the expenses for a group of students who like to go on road trips.</p>

<p>The group agrees in advance to share expenses equally, but it is not
practical to share every expense as it occurs. Thus individuals in
the group pay for particular things, such as meals, hotels, taxi rides,
and plane tickets. After the trip, each student's expenses are tallied
and money is exchanged so that the net cost to each is the same, to
within one cent. In the past, this money exchange has been tedious and
time consuming. Your job is to compute, from a list of students and
their personal expenses from the trip, the minimum amount of money 
that must change hands in order to equalize (within one cent) all 
the students' costs.</p>

<p>So, for example, Louis, Carter, and David took a trip together;
Louis incurred expenses of $5.75, $35.00, and $12.79, Carter paid
out $12.00, $15.00, and $23.23, and David covered $10.00, $20.00,
$38.41, and $45.00. Louis' total was $53.54, Carter's was $50.23,
and David shelled out $113.41. The total cost of the trip was thus
$217.18, and thus equal shares would be $72.39 1/3 cents. Therefore,
Louis owes David $18.85, and Carter owes David $22.16.</p>

<p>The output should include each student's name, and how much each
student needs to pay out to any others. For simplicity's sake, it is
safe to assume three students, two of which pay much less than the
third; however, if you want to make it a general-purpose solver to
work with any number of students, please feel free.</p>
</div>


<!-- 
  Interfaces
  -->
<div ng-show="interface === 'WebAPI'">
<h2>Web API</h2>
<p>We would like this to be a Web API endpoint, something that a Web
or mobile client could use over HTTP to obtain data from the server.
It should accept JSON (or XML, but we prefer JSON) as input, and
likewise return JSON as output. The actual fomat of the JSON (or
XML) is entirely up to you, but we would like you to use current
conventions and RESTful principles as your guide in the design.</p>

<p>The WebAPI should verify that the data in the incoming request
is acceptable input, but you may assume (for practical purposes)
that the incoming JSON (or XML) is always well-formed.</p>

<p>Any errors should be communicated using traditional Web API
(RESTful) error-reporting mechanisms.</p>
</div>


<div ng-show="interface === 'NativeUI'">
<h2>Native GUI</h2>
<p>We would like this to be a "native GUI" application; that is,
we want to interact using the native user interface components of
the platform. (This means specifically that we want to avoid the
use of Web-like tools that create a user interface hidden within
a Web browser on the system; we want you to write this using the
native SDK of the target platform.)</p>

<p>The UI does not need to be incredibly complicated--but if a simple
text area asking for a string of input is used, it is up to you to
verify that the input is correct and provide an example go along
with it.</p>
</div>


<div ng-show="interface === 'WebClientUI'">
<h2>Web (client) UI</h2>
<p>We would like you to build this as a "single-page application"
(or some other kind of entirely-browser-based solution). The user
interface should be written in tools that ultimately produce an
interface that can be loaded into a Web browser.</p>

<p>Typically this will involve using JavaScript and libraries 
such as Angular, Durandal, or Ember, but if you have alternates
that you would like to suggest and use, please let us know before
doing so--clients are sometimes very particular about the tools
used in their applications.</p>

<p>It will be safe to assume that any "storage" required by the
application can/should/will be done using Web APIs; you may
mock the storage for those as you need, but the application must
behave exactly the same if/when a back end is wired up to it.
If you prefer to use a real back-end, you may, but we urge you
not to spend a great deal of time on that--we are interested
(and will be evaluating you) solely on your front-end skills.</p>

<p>User interface is not a high
priority for us, so it need not look incredibly pretty (though
the use of a library like Bootstrap to help make it look at
least a little pretty is a bonus!), but it must be entirely
functional, and should be doing some basic validation of inputs.
In addition, the output should be on a separate page from the
inputs, in keeping with traditional Web style.</p>
</div>


<div ng-show="interface === 'WebServerUI'">
<h2>Web (Server) UI</h2>
<p>We would like you to build a traditional "browser-based app",
meaning a series of HTML-based web pages generated on the Web
server and transmitted back to the browser using HTTP when the
user clicks on controls or forms.</p>

<p>User interface is not a high
priority for us, so it need not look incredibly pretty (though
the use of a library like Bootstrap to help make it look at
least a little pretty is a bonus!), but it must be entirely
functional, and should be doing some basic validation of inputs.
In addition, the output should be on a separate page from the
inputs, in keeping with traditional Web style.</p>
</div>
    
    
<div ng-show="interface === 'WebService'">
<h2>WS-* Web Service</h2>
<p>We would like this to be a SOAP-based WSDL endpoint, using
XSD to describe the incoming and outgoing data types, in full
compliance with SOAP 1.2, WSDL 1.1 and XSD 1.0 Specifications.
Your WSDL should be usable from at least two platforms--the target
one we are asking you to build the implementation in, and one
other (using any toolkits of your choice on that other platform,
of course).</p>
</div>


<!-- 
  Languages
  -->
<div ng-show="language === 'Java'">
<h2>Java</h2>
<p>We would like you to do this project using the Java language; 
preferably Java7 or Java8. If you would prefer to use a different
language (such as Groovy, Scala, Clojure, or Kotlin), please check
with us first. We are not opposed to those languages ourselves,
but sometimes our clients require the use of Java.</p>
</div>


<div ng-show="language === 'C#'">
<h2>C#</h2>
<p>We would like you to do this project using the C# language, 
preferably using VisualStudio 2010, 2012 or 2013. If you would
prefer to use a different language (such as VB or F#), please check
with us first. We are not opposed to those languages ourselves, but
sometimes our clients require the use of C#.</p>
</div>


<div ng-show="language === 'JavaScript'">
<h2>JavaScript</h2>
</div>


<div ng-show="language === 'Scala'">
<h2>Scala</h2>
<p>We would like you to do this project using Scala, preferably 
at least Scala 2.10 or later. Use of any Scala-related libraries
(Play, Akka, Spray, etc) is perfectly acceptable, so long as they
are either included in the code sample or pulled in as part of a
build process (sbt, presumably).</p>
</div>


<!-- 
  Platforms
  -->
<div ng-show="platform === 'iOS'">
<h2>iOS</h2>
<p>We would like you to build this as an iOS mobile app, targeting
the latest released/stable version of the iOS operating system. We
will not ask you to upload it to the AppStore (though certainly that
is a bonus), but we will need to be able to side-load the application
through XCode to our own devices to run it, so please make sure the
project is ready to do that. (Assume that we have XCode latest and
a working Apple Developer license to do so.)</p>
</div>


<div ng-show="platform === 'Android'">
<h2>Android</h2>
<p>We would like you to build this as an Android mobile app, targeting
an Android 4.0 (IceCreamSandwich) device. We will not ask you to
upload it to the Play Store (though certainly that is a bonus), but
we will need to be able to side-load it to our own devices to run it,
so please ensure the project is ready to do that. (Assume that we have
the latest Android Studio and the latest SDK versions already.)</p>
</div>


<div ng-show="platform === 'NodeJS'">
<h2>NodeJS</h2>
<p></p>

<p>You may use any npm packages that you find helpful, so long as 
they are declared in the application's package.json file; you may
safely assume that we will run "npm install" on the source code before
running it. If there are any other particular instructions required
to run your app correctly, however, they must be documented or (ideally)
configured to run as part of a Gulp or Grunt file.</p>
</div>



<div ng-show="platform === 'Java'">
<h2>JVM</h2>
<p></p>

<p>You may use any Java libraries (Spring, Hibernate, etc) that you find helpful,
so long as they are either included in the code sample or pulled in
as part of a build process (such as that done with Maven or Gradle).</p>
</div>


<div ng-show="platform === '.NET'">
<h2>.NET</h2>
<p></p>

<p>You may use any .NET libraries (EntityFramework, third-party
control libraries such as those from Telerik or Infragistics) so
long as they are either included in the project or pulled in as part
of a build process (presumably with NuGet).</p>
</div>


<div ng-show="platform === 'Ruby'">
<h2>Ruby</h2>
</div>


<!-- 
  Quirks (combinations that require special care)
  -->
<div ng-show="language === 'Ruby' && platform === 'Android'">
<p>We strongly suspect that your program will use Ruboto; if for some
reason you have found a different way to do Ruby on the Android
platform, please check with us first, both because we want to verify
it will be acceptable and because we want to know about it!</p>
</div>


<!-- 
  Summary
  -->
<h2>Final Notes</h2>
<p>Your code should include all the necessary steps (either
automated as part of the build process, or in shell scripts that
we can run, or else documented very clearly on how to deploy
the app) such that we can run the code with a minimum of
work.</p>

<p>Please include a README with your submission that indicates any special instructions for running your code (Such as a NuGet package restore) and also include what selections you made for your Domain and Interface.</p>

<p>We look forward to hearing from you, evaluating your code, and
working with you further!</p>
